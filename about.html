      </div>
      <p>
        🌱 <strong>Founded in 1971</strong> in the historic Pike Place Market in Seattle, Washington, Starbucks began as
        a small store selling high-quality coffee beans and equipment. Inspired by the rich tradition of Italian
        espresso bars, Howard Schultz joined the company in the 1980s and transformed Starbucks into a coffeehouse where
        community and connection were just as important as coffee itself.
      </p>

      <p>
        🌍 Over the decades, Starbucks has grown into a global phenomenon with over <strong>35,000 stores</strong>
        worldwide. Each store is built to reflect the culture of its neighborhood, providing a warm and inviting
        environment where customers feel at home.
      </p>

      <p>
        ❤️ Our mission is simple but powerful: <em>“To inspire and nurture the human spirit — one person, one cup, and
          one neighborhood at a time.”</em>
      </p>

      <h3 class="mt-5 text-success">🌿 Passion for Coffee</h3>
      <p>
        ☕ At Starbucks, coffee is more than just a drink — it’s a passion. We source only the finest <strong>100%
          Arabica beans</strong>, grown and harvested with care from sustainable farms in Latin America, Africa, and
        Asia.
      </p>

      <p>
        🔥 Our expert roasters craft each batch to bring out the best flavor profile of every bean. Whether it’s a
        smooth Blonde Roast or a bold Espresso Roast, every cup is made with precision and love.
      </p>

      <h3 class="mt-5 text-success">🌎 Commitment to Community</h3>
      <p>
        👩‍🌾 Starbucks supports local communities and coffee farmers through ethical sourcing programs like
        <strong>C.A.F.E. Practices</strong>. We also invest in youth, education, and sustainability initiatives around
        the world.
      </p>

      <p>
        🌱 We’re committed to reducing our environmental impact by promoting reusable cups, eliminating plastic straws,
        and aiming for carbon neutrality.
      </p>
