    <p>
    🌱 <strong>Founded in 1971</strong> in the historic Pike Place Market in Seattle, Washington, Starbucks began as a small store selling high-quality coffee beans and equipment. Inspired by the rich tradition of Italian espresso bars, Howard Schultz joined the company in the 1980s and transformed Starbucks into a coffeehouse where community and connection were just as important as coffee itself.
  </p>

  <p>
    🌍 Over the decades, Starbucks has grown into a global phenomenon with over <strong>35,000 stores</strong> worldwide. Each store is built to reflect the culture of its neighborhood, providing a warm and inviting environment where customers feel at home.
  </p>

  <p>
    ❤️ Our mission is simple but powerful: <em>“To inspire and nurture the human spirit — one person, one cup, and one neighborhood at a time.”</em>
  </p>

  <h3 class="mt-5 text-success">🌿 Passion for Coffee</h3>
  <p>
    ☕ At Starbucks, coffee is more than just a drink — it’s a passion. We source only the finest <strong>100% Arabica beans</strong>, grown and harvested with care from sustainable farms in Latin America, Africa, and Asia.
  </p>

  <p>
    🔥 Our expert roasters craft each batch to bring out the best flavor profile of every bean. Whether it’s a smooth Blonde Roast or a bold Espresso Roast, every cup is made with precision and love.
  </p>

  <h3 class="mt-5 text-success">🌎 Commitment to Community</h3>
  <p>
    👩‍🌾 Starbucks supports local communities and coffee farmers through ethical sourcing programs like <strong>C.A.F.E. Practices</strong>. We also invest in youth, education, and sustainability initiatives around the world.
  </p>

  <p>
